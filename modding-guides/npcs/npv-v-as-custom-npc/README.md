# NPV - V as custom NPC

## Summary

**Created & Published: May 13 2023 by @manavortex**

This guide will show you how to do the following things:&#x20;

* Setting up a Wolvenkit project with the prepared example files (this section)
* Creating your V's head in Blender ([npv-preparing-the-head-in-blender.md](npv-preparing-the-head-in-blender.md "mention"))
* Customizing their appearance and clothes ([npv-creating-a-custom-npc.md](npv-creating-a-custom-npc.md "mention"))
* Making sure that they are unique so that you can share them ( [npv-cleanup-and-troubleshooting.md](npv-cleanup-and-troubleshooting.md "mention"))
* Creating a Photomode NPV ( [npv-amm-nibbles-replacer.md](npv-amm-nibbles-replacer.md "mention"))

### Wait, this is not what I want!

* If you want to change the player head, see [a-new-head-for-v.md](../a-new-head-for-v.md "mention")
* You can find more guides and resources for NPCs outside of the wiki. They are linked on the [community-guides](../../community-guides/ "mention") page.

#### Difficulty:

Easy, but not trivial: you don't need any prior knowledge, but the process is complex, and if you miss steps or deviate from the instructions, things will end up not working for you.

**This guide uses the following versions:**

* Cyberpunk 2077 game version >= 2.3
* Wolvenkit >= 8.15 ([Nightly](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit-nightly-releases/releases) | [Stable](https://github.com/WolvenKit/Wolvenkit/releases))
* The 3d editing tools  ( see [wkit-blender-plugin-current-version.md](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/installing-the-wolvenkit-blender-plugin/wkit-blender-plugin-current-version.md "mention") for the currently supported version):
  * [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
  * [wolvenkit-blender-io-suite](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/ "mention")
* [AppearanceMenuMod](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/790) >= 2.1

### Credit

None of this would have been possible without **NoraLee**, who pioneered the process and taught me everything that I needed to know to set up these tools. This guide doesn't use any of their resources, but a lot of their knowledge. For the full guide with all edge-cases, bells, whistles and context, see their [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R-knopKMhHDZuokPKaTt0nIDArXcQdrb).&#x20;

This is the speedrun version. If you want extra details and context, **please check Nora's Google Doc**.

## Preparation: The character preset

Due to the complexity of V's head mesh, you have to do a little bit of prep work here.

Don't worry, I'll walk you through it step by step.

To create a face, we need to know your character's values. For that, you need to have [AppearanceChangeUnlocker](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3850) installed, or you won't see them:

* Eyes
* Eyebrows
* Nose
* Mouth
* Jaw
* Ears

Find the mirror in V's apartment and note down the **numerical values**.

## Preparation: Setting up the project

1. Create [a Wolvenkit project](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/wolvenkit-projects#create-a-new-wolvenkit-mod-project)
2. Download the example files from [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/8328)
3. Merge the `source` folder in the download with the `source` folder in your Wolvenkit project directory
4. Switch to Wolvenkit and toggle the [project explorer](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/editor/project-explorer) to the [source tab](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/editor/project-explorer#source).
5. We will have **one NPC per Wolvenkit project** (I mean this!), so we'll delete the files for the body gender that we won't be using (find a table after the image)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



<table><thead><tr><th width="179">body gender</th><th>file path</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>female</td><td><ul><li><code>archive\tutorial\npv\your_female_character</code></li><li><code>raw\tutorial\npv\your_female_character</code></li><li><code>resources\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\AppearanceMenuMod\Collabs\Custom Entities\tutorial\tutorial_custom_female_character.lua</code></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>male</td><td><ul><li><code>archive\tutorial\npv\your_male_character</code></li><li><code>raw\tutorial\npv\your_male_character</code></li><li><code>resources\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\AppearanceMenuMod\Collabs\Custom Entities\tutorial\tutorial_custom_male_character.lua</code></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="danger" %}
This tutorial assumes that you will rename and re-path your files **at the very end**, because the prepared files rely on a certain file structure. We'll get to it!
{% endhint %}

## Check if it works

This is a working Wolvenkit project â€” let's make sure that it works.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
You can do this at any time during the tutorial to check your progress!
{% endhint %}

1. On the Wolvenkit toolbar, you'll find a button to [install the project](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/menu/toolbar#install-and-launch)
2. Click it
3. When the game starts, load a savegame
4. Open the CET overlay
5. Switch AMM to the "Spawn" tab
6. Search for `Tutorial`
7. Spawn `Tutorial Woman` or `Tutorial Man`

You should now see a person in front of you.

## Get cracking

Now it's time to do the actual work.&#x20;

* If you want to create your V's head for Cyberpunk, go to [npv-creating-a-custom-npc.md](npv-creating-a-custom-npc.md "mention")
* If you just want to set up the file structure, go to [npv-creating-a-custom-npc.md](npv-creating-a-custom-npc.md "mention")

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please remember that before sharing your NPV, you _**have**_ to change the paths! We will do this at the very end of the project, as the tooling requires the paths to be set up in a certain way.
