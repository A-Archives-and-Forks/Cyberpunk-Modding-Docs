  Lights are still somewhat of a mystery to me. That said, there are a couple
  routes to take for lights, depending on how you would like them to look.

# üö® Boe6's vehicles: Add lights

{% hint style="info" %}
Lights are using **emissive** (glowing) and **glass** materials. For more documentation about that, you can check [configuring-materials](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/materials/configuring-materials/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

Many lights, such as the headlights on the porsche, are reflective lights, with headlight lenses. These lenses require lots of lighting settings, such as `IOR`, `RefractionDepth`, `FresnelBias`, and more. \
Example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image193.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The other common option, is to use solid lights, as many modded cars do. These lights avoid using the complex light options, and instead opt to use block-style lights. These are done by creating a custom mesh, setting it as a light material, and covering it with blank normal map lenses or glass. (IOR=1.0 & RefractionDepth<0.2) \
Example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image70.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>(credit: ctxrlsec, Nissan Skyline GT-R R34)</p></figcaption></figure>

Here is an explanation of some light options, based on my own experience. Note that these values are not fully understood currently. If you learn something about these values, please share!

* **`IOR`** : ‚ÄúIndex of Refraction‚Äù. This seems to be an on/off switch for enabling refraction. Values greater than 1 enable refraction.
* **`RefractionDepth`**
* **`FresnelBias`** : Unknown. (does nothing?)
* **`NormalStrength`** : Strength of normal map on the mesh
* **`NormalMapAffectsSpecular`** : Strength of normal map on reflected light
* **`Normal`** : Path to normal map
* **`GlassRoughnessBias`** : n/a
* **`BlurRadius`** : n/a

For the emitted light beam, there are ‚Äú`vehicleLightComponent`‚Äùs in the `.app` file components list. The `localTransform` can be edited by the position `xyz` bit values. Orientation will control which direction the light is aimed. \
Example `LightComponent` localTransform values:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image160.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To create a new light in a mesh that doesn‚Äôt have one already, you can duplicate the material in the mesh settings. Make sure to update the `localMaterialBuffer` or `preloadLocalMaterialInstances`, `materialEntries`, and `appearance chunkMaterials`.\
See:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image81.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image215.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image209.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the vehicle\_lights material is linked in the mesh, it also need to be linked to a `vehicleLightComponent` in the `.app` file. You can use an existing `lightComponent` or duplicate a new one. The component has a `parentTransform` entry, and a `bindName` value which is used to set what mesh it is a part of. \
Example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image61.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image3 (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For lights like brakes, headlights, or reverse lights - you need to edit the vertex paint in **Blender**. Select the light emitting object in **blender** and switch to "**Vertex Paint"** mode. \
Example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image72.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Set the color to one that enables the brake behavior, for brakes this is red in hex:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image166.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You must use these specific hex colors for lights to be activated properly:

* Headlights: `#7C0101`&#x20;
* Taillights: `#e7010`
* Reverse lights: `#cb0000`



Use the **Draw tool** in **Vertex Paint** mode to draw on the color to the entire part. \
Example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image68.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Lights should now be fully working.



### Change headlight colors

Headlight colors are controlled in your vehicle's tweak file. You need to add this entry to your main `Vehicle` record:

```
headlightColor:
  - 0
  - 0
  - 255
  - 255
```

The values are RGBA respectively so the above changes the headlight color to blue

Adjusting the tweak file from the previous section, here's how it should all look like:

```
