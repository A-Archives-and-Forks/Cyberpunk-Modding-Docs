# ðŸš— Boe6's Guide: basic car from A to Z

In this guide Iâ€™ll be bringing a Mini Cooper into Cyberpunk 2077. All methods should translate to whatever vehicle you add. The guide assumes you follow along in order. The later steps **will** skip basic info covered in previous steps, unless its written otherwise.

\
If at any point you get stuck & have questions, Reach out! Try the Mod Development section of the modding discord!  [https://discord.gg/Epkq79kd96](https://discord.gg/Epkq79kd96) #mod-dev-chat can be used for general questions, or the specific channels for your issue, like #textures-and-models (you might want to remember this one!) You can also DM me on discord **@boe6**, I can't promise fast replies but I'll help however I can :)

\
If you discover info or additional details that you figured out during this guide, consider adding to the wiki! Check out the wiki editing guide here: [https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/the-wiki](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/the-wiki)

This guide may not cover all 2.0 changes. Most everything should be correct, let me know if you find any issues.
