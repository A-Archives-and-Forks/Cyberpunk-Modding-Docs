# Boe6's Guide: basic car from A to Z

## Summary

**Published:** Oct 19 2023 by [Meta Pixel](https://app.gitbook.com/u/9PYjUBpLrFhif4MmMN1WyrRuFFG3 "mention"), based on knowledge by [Boe6Eod7Nty](https://app.gitbook.com/u/iq3Mkow3iEgQH4rO6jJjq3hazpc2 "mention")\
**Last documented update:** May 04 2024 by [mana vortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")

This guide will show you how to add a car to the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide may not cover all 2.0 changes. Most everything should be correct, let me know if you find any issues.
{% endhint %}

### Wait, this is not what I want!

* For a guide on how to visually change base game vehicles, see [altering-appearances-within-wolvenkit-full-workflow.md](../../npcs/appearances-change-the-looks/altering-appearances-within-wolvenkit-full-workflow.md "mention") (the process is the same for cars)
* If you want to change the way a vehicle **behaves**, you need to alter the [vehicle-drive-model-data-record.md](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/references-lists-and-overviews/vehicles/vehicle-drive-model-data-record.md "mention")&#x20;
* For the visual learners among us, there is a video series by boe6. It's not complete and the information may be outdated, but you can find them here:

## The guide

In this guide Iâ€™ll be bringing a Mini Cooper into Cyberpunk 2077. All methods should translate to whatever vehicle you add. The guide assumes you follow along in order. The later steps **will** skip basic info covered in previous steps, unless its written otherwise.

### Finding help

If at any point during this guide you get stuck, or if you have questions, find us on the  [redmodding discord](https://discord.gg/redmodding)!

You can ask general questions in `#mod-dev-chat`, or find a channel for specific issues (such as `#textures-and-models`,  you might want to remember this one.)&#x20;

You can also DM me on discord **@boe6**, I can't promise fast replies but I'll help however I can :)

{% hint style="info" %}
To make it easier for future modders, please **update the guide** if you can make it better or have learned something! Check [#why-you-should-edit-the-wiki](../../../the-wiki/#why-you-should-edit-the-wiki "mention"), or if you're already convinced, see our [editing-guidelines](../../../the-wiki/editing-guidelines/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

Alright, let's get started: Proceed to [precursor-information-to-know.md](precursor-information-to-know.md "mention").\
