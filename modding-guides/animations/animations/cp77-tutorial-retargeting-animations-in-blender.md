This guide will teach you how to retarget game animations for other armatures. It assumes that you're generally familiar with the process.

### Wait, this is not what I want!

To learn about making animations, check the [..](../ "mention") category, such as

* [poses-animations-make-your-own](poses-animations-make-your-own/ "mention")
* [amm-collab-anims-poses.md](amm-collab-anims-poses.md "mention")

You can also check the [**Retargeting Tutorial**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrPTKiGJzy2Tj_klJVHhRdXZgqD7yC2ZsJuRu9nqQuc/edit) by Halkuonn, which uses a different plugin. This is most useful for single frame poses, but won't work for animations!

### Requirements

* You need to have a [Wolvenkit Project](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/wolvenkit-projects)
* The guide requires a Blender plugin and a pose template; the steps below will walk you through that.

## 1. Installing the Rokoko Plugin

{% hint style="info" %}
As of January 2025, the plugin is **free**, but requires you to have a Rokoko account.
{% endhint %}

1. Download the Rokoko Plugin from its [official website](https://www.rokoko.com/integrations/blender)

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_2.png)

2. Install it like any Blender AddOn (for a step-by-step guide, follow the instructions under [installing-the-wolvenkit-blender-plugin](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/installing-the-wolvenkit-blender-plugin/ "mention") -> [#step-1-install-the-plugin](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/installing-the-wolvenkit-blender-plugin/#step-1-install-the-plugin "mention")
3. Create an account\
   &#xNAN;_&#x54;his is completely free and you can sign in via your Google account_

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_4.png)

Once signed in, you can return to blender

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_5.png)

For the sake of this tutorial, we‚Äôll focus on the **Retargeting** tab

Close up everything else üëÄ

## 2. Gathering Files

{% hint style="info" %}
This tutorial will retarget Alex's dance to the MaleAverage rig. If you retarget something else, download the necessary files.
{% endhint %}

### The pose template

You need to download Angy's pose templates. You can find the most recent link under [easy-ik-based-posing.md](poses-animations-make-your-own/easy-ik-based-posing.md "mention") -> [#requirements](poses-animations-make-your-own/easy-ik-based-posing.md#requirements "mention")

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_8.png)

Download the desired template and open it in Blender.

### The animation

1. Add the .anims file that you want to your Wolvenkit project. This guide will use alex's dance:\
   `ep1\animations\quest\main_quests\q304\q304_04e_alex_heart_to_heart\body\q304_04e_alex_heart_to_heart__alex.anims`
2. Export the animation (see [wkit-blender-plugin-import-export.md](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/wkit-blender-plugin-import-export.md "mention") -> [#animations](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/wkit-blender-plugin-import-export.md#animations "mention"))

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_9.png)

## 3. Import the animation into Blender

see [wkit-blender-plugin-import-export.md](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/wkit-blender-plugin-import-export.md "mention") -> [#animations](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/wkit-blender-plugin-import-export.md#animations "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
For the sake of this tutorial, I renamed the MaleAverage armature to `MA` and Alex' animation to `ALEX`
{% endhint %}

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_10.png)

### 3.1. Selecting the animation

1. Select the source armature (`Alex`)
2. Open the `CP77 Modding` tool
3. Open the `Animation Tools` menu
4. The `Animsets` list will be populated with all animations available for the current armature

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_11.png)

5. Click the Play button of any animation that you want to retarget
6. You should see the armature bones move to the chosen anim (the model will not move):

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_12.gif)

7. Press space or the pause button ‚è∏ on the timeline to stop the anim

## 4. Actual retargeting

### 4.1 Configuring the Rokoko Plugin

1. Select your **Target** Armature, in my case `MA`
2. Open the **`Rokoko`** tab
3. focus on the **Retargeting** menu
   1. `Source`: The source armature (`Alex`)
   2. `Target`: The target armature (`MA`)

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_13.png)

4. Press `Build Bone List`

### 4.2 Double-checking and cleanup

Since we‚Äôre retargeting a CP77 anim to another rig, the bones share the same names between the armatures, making this step really easy - However I still recommend reading through the list and **verifying that everything does match!**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_14.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
I recommend leaving the **Root**, **Trajectory** and **Reference\_Joint** **empty** regardless of the type of animation you‚Äôre retargeting
{% endhint %}

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_16.png)

#### Adjustments

For example, we can see that the **LeftUpLeg** and **RightUpLeft** doesn‚Äôt automatically match; to fix that, simply click on the miss-matching bones names and select the right ones

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_15.png)

### 4.3 Push the button

1. Check the `Auto Scale` box
2. Make sure that `Use Pose:` has the `Rest` pose selected

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_17.png)

3. Press Retarget Animation

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_18.png)

4. Your Template model should automatically get into a pose
5. press space or the start button ‚ñ∂ on the timeline to see the animation!

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_19.gif)

You might see some deformation or bones breaking; that‚Äôs ok! It won‚Äôt happen in game (don‚Äôt ask me how, it‚Äôs _Engine Magic_ ‚ú®)

### 4.1 Optional: Delete all animations

This will make it easier to keep track of your animation in Wolvenkit:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_delete_anims.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 4.2 Adjusting the time frame

If your animation loops or is cut off in the middle, change your **timeline frame zone** with the exact amount of frame in the animation

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pkd_retargeting_animations_20.png)

From there, follow the regular Pose Making workflow (you can find step-by-step instructions under [poses-animations-make-your-own](poses-animations-make-your-own/ "mention") -> [#step-2-creating-the-animation](poses-animations-make-your-own/#step-2-creating-the-animation "mention"))

## 5. Importing into Wolvenkit

We still need a container ([`.anims` file](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/files-and-what-they-do/file-formats/animations-.anims/)) to import into.&#x20;

For male average anims, I recommend using this file:

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```
base\animations\npc\generic_characters\male_average\interactive_scene\generic_male_average__stand__2h_on_sides__02.anims
```
{% endcode %}

since it has a single animation and is easy to clean.





TODO: Port the second half of [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHPQvkK6ijwb8iQ8y1X8CBG-wnNUCTYCjrdUCGMenW4/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHPQvkK6ijwb8iQ8y1X8CBG-wnNUCTYCjrdUCGMenW4/edit?tab=t.0) (the importer shat itself, so it's a carbon copy anyway)
