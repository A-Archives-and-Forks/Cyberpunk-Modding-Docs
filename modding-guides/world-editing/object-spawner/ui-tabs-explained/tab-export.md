# Tab: Export

## Exporting

* For information on how to export, follow the [Exporting to WolvenKit](../exporting-from-object-spawner.md) guide

## Export Templates

* Since you will probably want to export your builds frequently, to make sure everything looks correct and works as expected in the native world edit, you can use export templates to save export settings
* Simply add all the groups to export as you would, setup their extents, variants, category, etc.
* Then, press "Save as Template", to save everything you setup into an easily reusable template
* Keep in mind that changing a groups name will remove it from any template in which it is used
