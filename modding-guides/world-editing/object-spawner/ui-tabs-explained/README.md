# UI Tabs Explained

* This section will cover all features of each UI tab (Hopefully nothing has been forgoten)
  * [Spawn New](tab-spawn-new.md): The place to spawn new things from
  * [Favorites and Prefabs](tab-favorites-and-prefabs.md): This is where you spawn favorites from, organize and browse them
  * [Spawned](tab-spawned.md): This is the core of the mod, with a split view giving you the spawned objects and properties
  * [Saved](tab-saved.md): This is where you find everything you have saved, and allows you to add it to the export
  * [Export](tab-export.md): This is where the final steps happen, before importing the build into WolvenKit
