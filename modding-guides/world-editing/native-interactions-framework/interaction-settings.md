# Interaction Settings

{% hint style="success" %}
This section covers "Simple Interactions", which do not require props
{% endhint %}

## Editing Interactions

* To edit an interaction, press the "Cog" icon to the right of its name
* This will bring you over to the "Edit Interaction" tab

{% hint style="success" %}
When using any positional controls, you can hold down "Shift" to switch to precision mode
{% endhint %}

### Icon

* All interactions allow for control over the icon they show in the game-world, as well as when to show the actual interaction prompt
* `Icon Position`:
  * This controls where the icon is
* `Icon Visibility Range`:
  * This controls how close the player has to be to the Icon Position for the icon to show
* `Interaction Range`:
  * This controls how close the player has to be to the Icon Position for the interaction prompt to show
* `Interaction Angle`:
  * This controls how close the screen center / crosshair needs to be to the icon, in order for the interaction prompt to show (Smaller means closer)

### Workspot Position

{% hint style="success" %}
The Workspot Position control is available for any interaction which plays an animation at a specific position
{% endhint %}

* `Workspot Position`:
  * Controls where the animation will play
* `Workspot Orientation`:
  * Controls in what rotation the animation will play (Usually the green arrow points inwards)
