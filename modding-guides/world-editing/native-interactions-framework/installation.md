# Installation

## Requirements

* First, download and install all requirements:
  * [Red4Ext](https://github.com/wopss/RED4ext)
  * [CET](https://github.com/maximegmd/CyberEngineTweaks)
  * [Codeware](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware)
  * [Redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript)
  * [ArchiveXL](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl)

## Download

* Next, download Native Interaction Framework:
  * [Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21422)
* Optionally download [World Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20660), as it is required if you want to place interactions which use props

## Installing

* Install the mod as any other mod, by extracting the downloaded file into the base game directory, or using a mod manager
  * The base game directory is called `Cyberpunk 2077` and contains the folders `bin` and `archive`

If you unzipped the file correctly, you will now have the following folder:

`Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\nativeInteractions`
{% endhint %}
