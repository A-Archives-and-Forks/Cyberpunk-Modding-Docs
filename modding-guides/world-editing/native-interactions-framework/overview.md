# Overview

## What is Native Interactions Framework

* Native Interactions Framework (NIF) allows modders to easily place supported interactions in the game world
* No need to edit files or scenes by hand, everything is done through an in-game UI
* It also offers interactions which interact with the environment, such as sitting and controlling the TV
* Creations can [easily be shared](getting-started.md#sharing-creations) and be made part of your mods

Interactions are one of two categories:

Simple: No additional setup is needed

With Props: Interaction uses additional props, which need to be placed
