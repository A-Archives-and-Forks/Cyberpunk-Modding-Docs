# Removing Objects

{% hint style="success" %}
The terms `Object` and `Node` will be used interchangeably in most guides, Node is just the more general description of _something_ that is part of the game world
{% endhint %}

## The right workflow

You can pick between four different workflows for object removal.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to **edit** objects instead, see [removing-grass-and-small-foliage.md](removing-grass-and-small-foliage.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

#### Remove objects in-game

Best for **beginners** who want to get **quick results**: the easiest workflow. If you follow the instructions, you're ten minutes away from having a shareable mod.

⇒ See [world-editing-deleting-objects.md](world-editing-deleting-objects.md "mention").

#### Remove a FUCKTON of objects

Best to remove a certain **kind** of object or clean up a large **area**. Think "nuke it from the orbit", but it supports filtering.

⇒ Check [VS2077](https://github.com/notaspirit/VolumetricSelection2077)

#### Remove objects in Blender

Best if you want to see where we came from: this is the very first workflow we had, and it will take you on an extended tour of the past. If you are easily frustrated or have no idea about modding, you should stay away from this.

⇒ See [world-object-removal-with-blender.md](world-object-removal-with-blender.md "mention")

#### Remove objects by hand

Best if you enjoy suffering. We don't recommend the manual process anymore, but it can be helpful to understand what's going on under the hood.
