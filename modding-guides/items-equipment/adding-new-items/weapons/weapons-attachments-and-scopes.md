## Component visibility

Component visibility is defined by the `visibilityAnimationParam`:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/weapon_component_visibility.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Displayed as in <code>w_smg__militech_saratogabase1_01.ent</code></p></figcaption></figure>

To always display a component, set the value to `None` (clear the field).

{% hint style="warning" %}
TODO: which values are allowed here? Where do we get them from?
{% endhint %}
