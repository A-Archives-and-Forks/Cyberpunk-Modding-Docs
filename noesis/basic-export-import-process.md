# Basic export/import process

## Exporting

Open your .mesh file in Noesis64.exe, then right click on it inside the app and press Export, from there you will be given file extensions to export into, .FBX is the go-to for any usual process and for easier importing into 3D Apps like Blender and 3DS Max.

Same goes for .xbm files.

## Importing

Open your 3d file (like .fbx or .glb) in Noesis64.exe, export and select **.mesh - CyberPunk 2077 mesh \[PC]**, when a dialogue box shows up browse and select the .mesh file that is appropriate for your import(for example if it was a shirt you'd probably export over .mesh files that has shirts in them), then click OK.
