# Introduction

_From the website:_ Noesis is a tool for previewing and converting between hundreds of model, image, and animation formats. It utilizes a robust plugin system, with support for native extension modules and Python scripts.

Noesis is considered one of Cyberpunk 2077 Modding's cornerstones for its ability to open .mesh files and convert it into a wide variety of other 3d file extensions (like GLB and FBX) thanks to alphaZomega's CP77 Python script that makes that possible.
