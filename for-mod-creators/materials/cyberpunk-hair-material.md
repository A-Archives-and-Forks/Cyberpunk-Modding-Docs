# Cyberpunk Hair Material

Hair properties are collected in `.hp` (hair profile) files. Each hair profile has two greyscale maps and a gradient.&#x20;

It does not use a normal map.



## Gradient

A gradient with hair colour information. This is used to color individual strands via the ID map.

## ID(entity)

Maps the individual hair strands by colour: Value <=> position on the gradient

## Flow

Controls "bending" direction of hair by assigning a colour to the strand.&#x20;

### FlowStrength

A multiplier how strongly this should affect hair
