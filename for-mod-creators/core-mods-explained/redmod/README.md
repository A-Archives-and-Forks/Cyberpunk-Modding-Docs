# REDmod

REDmod is a **modding framework** and a set of command line **tools** for modding _Cyberpunk 2077_ that allow you to compile script and tweak source files and allow for sound and animation modding.

If you already have REDMod installed and just want to enable mods, check [here](../../../for-mod-users/users-modding-cyberpunk-2077/redmod/usage.md#activating-mods).
{% endhint %}

## Installation

> To start creating mods or using mods for _Cyberpunk 2077_ you must first install REDmod.

REDmod is shipped as free DLC with the game. You need to add it inside the platform store (GOG, Steam, Epic). You can click the link below, or find more detailed instructions further down on the page.

If you're accessing Cyberpunk through Steam Family Sharing, you'll be unable to install REDMod (thanks, Steam!). In this case, you can ask the person who's family sharing with you for their `Tools` folder.
