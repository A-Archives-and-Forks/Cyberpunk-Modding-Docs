# ArchiveXL: Tags

## Summary

**Published:** ??? by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")\
**Last documented update:** Feb 18 2024 by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")

This page will tell you about **tags** and how they can be used to influence item behaviour. It also teaches you how [#adding-custom-tags](archivexl-tags.md#adding-custom-tags "mention") can help you conditionally un-hide items.

### Wait, this is not what I want!

* Tags are used for calculating Garment Support score, see  [garment-support-how-does-it-work](../../3d-modelling/garment-support-how-does-it-work/ "mention")
* There is an own page for [influencing-other-items.md](../../modding-guides/items-equipment/influencing-other-items.md "mention")

## What do tags do?

Tags are a way to tell Cyberpunk that an item has certain properties and should behave in a certain way. This makes the game apply properties to your items, which can then be utilized by the game and ArchiveXL to

* hiding V's junk to stop it from clipping through tight pants (`hide_Genitals`)
* forcing female V's feet to be flat (`force_FlatFeet`)
* showing hair while wearing a head item (`force_Hair`)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please keep in mind that you need to add those to the [.app file](../../files-and-what-they-do/appearance-.app-files.md)'s **appearance definition** rather than the root or mesh entity.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Tags are case-sensitive!

### Hiding body parts: diagram

The diagrams below are somewhat outdated. Especially the arms information is not accurate. ([Arms are terrible and we hates them, precious](../../modding-guides/items-equipment/influencing-other-items.md#arms).)

## Root entity tags

There are a few tags that can be added to the root entity **or** in the .app file. Here's a list:

#### EmptyAppearance

This will hide an item under certain conditions. Add the following tag to the root entity:

`EmptyAppearance:FPP`

You have the following other options to achieve the same end:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="209"></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Root entity appearance<br>(does not need dynamic variants)</td><td><code>name</code>: <code>my_appearance&#x26;FPP</code></td><td>.app path: <code>base\characters\appearances\player\items\empty_appearance.app</code><br><code>default</code></td></tr><tr><td>.app <a href="../../modding-guides/items-equipment/adding-new-items/archivexl-dynamic-variants.md#conditional-switching-picking-appearances-by-name">conditional appearance</a>: change default appearance name</td><td><code>name</code>: <code>my_appearance&#x26;camera=tpp</code></td><td>ArchiveXL will automatically add empty appearances for anything you have not defined</td></tr><tr><td>.app <a href="../../modding-guides/items-equipment/adding-new-items/archivexl-dynamic-variants.md#conditional-switching-picking-appearances-by-name">conditional appearance</a>: add empty appearance yourself</td><td><code>name</code>: <code>my_appearance&#x26;camera=fpp</code></td><td>no partsValues, no components.<br>Do not do this - use the line above this one instead!</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### `force_Hair`

By default, head items turn hair invisible. By adding this tag to the root entity, you can override this process.

#### `force_FlatFeet`

Only works with a foot item as `$base` in the `.yaml`: use this if you're making flat shoes and don't want female V's feet to look as if she was wearing heels.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This tag will turn feet invisible for mascV unless the user has switch feet installed. You want to apply this to a conditional appearance in the .app file (`&gender=m`)
{% endhint %}

## Adding custom tags

Custom tags let you set [component chunk masks](../../files-and-what-they-do/components/#chunkmask) from the .xl file without the need of touching either .app or .ent file.

{% hint style="danger" %}
For this, it is mandatory that you have unique component names. If you include your modder name, it's unlikely that anyone will overwrite them by accident.
{% endhint %}

### **Why would I need this?** [partsOverrides](../../files-and-what-they-do/appearance-.app-files.md#partsoverrides) **exists!**

1. PartsOverrides can't un-hide components for you. It can only hide them. If you want to load a different mesh (for example, a de-formed hakama when wearing a kimono or haori), then you're flat out of luck.
2. By being clever about your submeshes, you can offer different versions of your mesh (cropped! No arms! No legs), and users only need to install an .xl file! No need to have different meshes or even different .archive files.

Not convinced? Pity, but if you find a new use case for those things, do [edit it in](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/-MP5ijqI11FeeX7c8-N8/H70HZBOeUulIpkQnBLK7)!

### **Example**

#### Registering the tag

Add custom tags **in your `.xl` file** (not in your `.yaml`!)

```
overrides:
  tags:
    my_custom_unhiding_tag:
      my_hidden_component_name: {show: [0, 1, 2, 3]}
    my_HideSeamfix:
      t0_000_pma_base__full_seamfix: {hide: [0, 1, 2, 3]}
```

#### Connecting the tag with the item

Simply add the tag to your appearance's tags array near the bottom of the individual entries.
