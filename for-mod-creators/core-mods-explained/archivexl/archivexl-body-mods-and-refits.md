# ArchiveXL: body mods and refits

Starting with version 1.5, Archive XL supports **tags for body mods** ! That means, no more compatibility archives, since AXL can simply load different meshes for youâ€¦

Body type detection works with simple body replacements and with the character creator extensions (customization system).

## Checking the current body mod

Run the following code snippet in CET to see which body type you have installed:

```
print(Game.GetScriptableSystemsContainer():Get("PuppetStateSystem"):GetBodyTypeSuffix(ItemID.new(), GetPlayer(), nil))
```

## Body modders: Adding support

### Adding an .xl configuration file

1. Create an .xl file in your Wolvenkit Project's resources folder
2. Optional, but recommended: Give it the same name as your Wolvenkit project
3. Put the following file content:

```yaml
player:
  bodyTypes: [ NewBody ]  # this will be converted to snake case: new_body
```

### Register the body mod in the .archive

In any of the files you modded, check your `components`:

#### Does any of them have a type that's called something with `morphtargetComponent`?&#x20;

**Yes:** \
Add a **tag** with the exact name of your body in this component's tag array (for our example, `NewBody`)

**No:**\
Add a new component (of any type) and give it the following name: \
`Body:NewBody`

After packing your project, [check if the body tag registers](archivexl-body-mods-and-refits.md#checking-the-current-body-mod) by running the CET command.&#x20;

If yes, you're good to go!

If not and you have used a **component**, you can check if the component is added to the playerPuppet by checking [RedHotTools](../../modding-tools/redhottools.md):

## Clothing mods: Making use of the tags

### Dynamic Appearances

If you're using [dynamic appearances](./#dynamic-appearances), you don't need to register a suffix and can simply match or substitute for the body tag:

```
appearance name:
t0_recoloured_netrunner_suit&body=new_body

substitution:
*my\mod\meshes\p{gender}a_netrunning_suit_{body}.mesh
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If no body mod is installed, the value will be `base_body`, so make sure to name your files and folders accordingly!
{% endhint %}

### Suffixes

If you're sticking to the classical approach, you need to add the following lines to your `.yaml`:

```yaml
  appearanceSuffixes:
    - !append itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.BodyType
```

Now, you can use the suffixes in your [root entity](../../files-and-what-they-do/entity-.ent-files/#root-entity) just like camera states or body genders:

```
appearanceName: my_custom_shirt&FPP&NewBody
```
