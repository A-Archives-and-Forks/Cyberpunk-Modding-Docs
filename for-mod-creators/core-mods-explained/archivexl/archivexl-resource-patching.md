# ArchiveXL: Resource patching

## Summary

**Published:** May 18 2024 by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")\
**Last documented update:** May 18 2024 by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")

This guide will teach you how to achieve the ultimate **definition deduplication** via **resource patching**, using mesh materials as an example.&#x20;

For the most efficient way to define multiple materials, check out [archivexl-dynamic-materials.md](../../modding-guides/textures-and-luts/archivexl-dynamic-materials.md "mention")!
{% endhint %}

## Why do I need this?

While [archivexl-body-mods-and-refits](archivexl-body-mods-and-refits/ "mention") has solved one problem, it introduced a new one. You now have a bunch of meshes inside your .archive, and you have to copy the materials across each of them.

## How do I use this?

Add the following lines to your `.xl` file:

```yaml
resource:
    patch:        
        tutorial\archive_xl\your_new_item\materials.mesh: # relative path to your material mesh
            - tutorial\archive_xl\your_new_item\pwa.mesh
            - tutorial\archive_xl\your_new_item\pma.mesh
```

And just like that, it will work.

## What else can I patch?

You can patch pretty much everything! Give it a try via `.xl` file.&#x20;

### Distributed patching: Scopes

Some things are scattered across multiple files â€” for example, there are different player entities for first and third person. Fortunately, ArchiveXL solves this problem in the cradle by defining patchable scopes. You can find examples on the github repository:

* the [player ent](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl/blob/a10cc78a42da5b3ad0f6aafe94ca4f546626c122/data/PlayerBaseScope.xl)
* [player hairs](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl/blob/a10cc78a42da5b3ad0f6aafe94ca4f546626c122/data/PlayerCustomizationHairFix.xl)
* [player appearances](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl/blob/a10cc78a42da5b3ad0f6aafe94ca4f546626c122/data/PlayerCustomizationScope.xl)

Use them like this:

```yaml
resource:
    patch:
        tutorial\archive_xl\player_patch.ent:
          - !include player.ent # or player_ma.ent / player_wa.ent
```

### Expanding scopes

If it becomes necessary, you can expand scopes and add your own files to them. For example:

```yaml
resource:
  scope:
    player_customization.app:
      - your_modder_name\patches\your_custom.app
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
You can't overwrite scopes, and you can't remove anything from them. Only appending is possible!
{% endhint %}
