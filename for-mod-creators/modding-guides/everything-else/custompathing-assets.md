# Custompathing assets

**Published: January 16 2024  by @madmaximusjb**

This guide will teach you how to set game assets as new files. Don't worry, it's really simple!\
We're taking this Liberty handgun mesh (I think it used to belong to some Dexter guy\`?) and make our own copy of the file.

## Prerequisites

You need a [Wolvenkit Project](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/wolvenkit-projects). But if you're reading this, you probably have one already.

## Custompathing game files

Find the original file at `base\weapons\firearms\handgun\constitutional_liberty\entities\meshes\w_handgun__constitutional_liberty__base1_01.mesh` and [add it to your project](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/editor/asset-browser#adding-files-to-projects).

In the [project explorer](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/editor/project-explorer), right click > copy > paste wherever you want it. Change the file name and you're done, it's that simple. Now you can export the file, change whatever you want, and re-import it.&#x20;

## Custompathing stuff in game files

{% hint style="danger" %}
This section should teach you how to use e.g. custom .mlsetups in mesh files, or custom meshes in .app files. It doesn't exist yet. Maybe you want to [sign up](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/-MP5ijqI11FeeX7c8-N8/H70HZBOeUulIpkQnBLK7) and write it?
{% endhint %}

## Until next time, chooms!
