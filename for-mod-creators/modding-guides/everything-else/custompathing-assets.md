# Custompathing assets

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide will teach you how to create own copies of game assets instead of overwriting the original files. Unfortunately, it is only a stub â€“ if you feel like changing that, please [sign up to the wiki](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/3d-modelling/exporting-and-importing-meshes/porting-3d-objects-to-cyberpunk) and get cracking!
{% endhint %}
