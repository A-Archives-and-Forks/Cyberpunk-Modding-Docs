# Scaling Poses/Animations

I noticed Photo Mode V is huge, and sometimes, specific pose packs have different character scaling. For example, the MascV in [MrsFlower’s MascV idle pose pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4366) is smaller than the MascV in my [MascV Joytoys](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6786) and [MascV Yorinobu](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6784) pose packs. With the enabling of Holopointz, I was able to figure out why this occurs and how to “adjust” the scaling.

This guide is mainly a supplement to xBaebsae’s tutorials and resources. This guide allows you to scale armatures as desired for your VP, personal, etc., needs when you make pose packs and/or animations. This is TPP only.

NOTE: Retargeting poses and/or animations will adjust the scale. So a retargeted Fem V pose will make the Masc V pose a bit smaller and vice versa.

If anyone figures out a more efficient way to do this, please do not hesitate to contact me and improve on this knowledge.



## STEP ONE

Open up your template of choice. There is also a multiple armature template if you want to make shippy or choomy poses, and I will use it for this tutorial.



## STEP TWO

Select your desired armature and go into Object Mode. The armature bones should turn orange.&#x20;

IF YOU NEED TO RESET THE SCALE, HIT ALT + S!



## STEP THREE

Go to the right-hand side of the screen while your armature of choice is selected, and go into the Items tab. It should look like this.

## STEP FOUR

There are several ways to do this. Please remember that X moves side-to-side and will make the armature wide or narrow, Y moves front-to-back, and Z moves up or down, making the armature taller or shorter. You can do this via the Dimensions tab, but you can also adjust as needed in the Scale tab. I think the Scale tab gives better results.

Let’s say we want to make FemV taller than MascV at around the same “height” as Man Big. I put in some values below.

## STEP FIVE

Now that you have your scale to your preference, you need to apply it. Hit Ctrl + A and select scale, or your changes will not be applied! Your armature will remain the default size when you import!

After you hit Ctrl + A and apply the scale, the armature will change appropriately. Ta-da! Import your pose, and this is what you will see in-game.

If you look closely, the armature has changed proportions from when the scale was applied.

If you did not get your desired result or created a curse, hit CTRL + Z and keep adjusting the values, and apply as needed. This may need to take some trial and error. :)

Please remember, you NEED to CTRL + S + Scale!

## STEP SIX

Have fun! I hope this inspires a lot of awesome poses, especially shippy ones. You also have the power to create some hysterical curses, as seen below.
