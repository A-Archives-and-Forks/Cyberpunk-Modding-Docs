### Wait, this is not what I want!

## What you can find here

Boe6 has been so nice to share their (very detailed) [guide on Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a5Xvviw_GQxcvbxEwc3GoboaNk0igxlhiyS7ux34sIs/edit?usp=sharing) and given full permission to transfer it to the wiki. However, the transfer is a work in progress (check [boe6s-guide-new-car-from-a-to-z](../../../modding-guides/vehicles/boe6s-guide-new-car-from-a-to-z/ "mention"))

A second guide is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1db16DhXj8xxDnLJryGW6Ge5p39NDrPVRU5Gs6f3YGoI/edit), although it is not very detailed.

For the visual learners among us, you can find a youtube video series by boe6 here:
