# ðŸš— Boe6's Guide: new car from A to Z

In this guide Iâ€™ll be bringing a Mini Cooper into Cyberpunk 2077. All methods should translate to whatever vehicle you add. The guide assumes youâ€™ve generally followed along in order. The later steps will skip basic info covered in previous steps, unless its written otherwise.

\
If at any point you get stuck & have questions, DM me on discord **@boe6**, or ask in one of the MODDING sections of the Cyberpunk 2077 Modding Discord. [https://discord.gg/Epkq79kd96](https://discord.gg/Epkq79kd96)

\
If you discover info or additional details that you figured out during this guide, please right-click and add a comment in [the original document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a5Xvviw\_GQxcvbxEwc3GoboaNk0igxlhiyS7ux34sIs/edit?usp=sharing) so the guide can be updated! (do not ask questions in comments, use discord please)&#x20;

This guide may not cover all 2.0 changes. Most everything should be correct, let me know if you find any issues.
