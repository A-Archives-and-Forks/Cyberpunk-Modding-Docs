# â˜  New Iconic Weapon : Tutorial for Dummies

{% hint style="danger" %}
This article is a stub and is not done yet! It's still missing the following sections:&#x20;

* Tweak changes for a weapon
* Creating a unique weapon skin
* Adding iconic mods
* Creating custom attachments
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the following software installed and properly set up:

1. **WolvenKit (8.12+)** - [Installed & Setup](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/getting-started/download)
2. **MLSB (MultiLayerSetupBuilder 1.6.7+)** - [Installed & Setup](../../../../modding-tools/mlsetup-builder/#installation)
3. **A text editor:** [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or, if you want to get fancy, [Visual Studio Code](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-McniwB8YOK2HnJ7SYg\_/getting-started)
4. **Cyberpunk 2077** - ðŸ˜‘
5. Core mods: [ArchiveXL](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198), [TweakXL](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197), [Red4Ext](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380)
6. Optional: [RedHotTools](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-red-hot-tools/releases/)

## Step 1: Create a New Project in WolvenKit

Start by opening WolvenKit and create a new project. This will be the base for your new iconic weapon mod.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (179).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create a new WolvenKit project as shown here</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (180).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A clean project should look like this (as of Wolvenkit 8.12, your interface may look different)</p></figcaption></figure>

## Step 2: Choose the Base Weapon

Decide on the weapon you want to modify to make a new new iconic. For this tutorial, we will use the gun 'Unity' as our base. The item ID for Unity is `Items.Preset_Unity_Default`.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a list of all weapon entities, check [weapons.md](../../../../references-lists-and-overviews/equipment/weapons.md "mention")&#x20;

You can find a list of all in-game items [here](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=EF6891140DE637B3%21221903\&authkey=!AE\_n4RTzwmVHwy8).
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (182).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Open Tweak Browser &#x26; search "Items.Preset_Unity_Default"</p></figcaption></figure>

## Step 3: Create a TweakXL Override

{% hint style="info" %}
To read more about Tweak modding, check [tweaks.md](../../../../files-and-what-they-do/tweaks.md "mention"). This isn't necessary for understanding this guide!
{% endhint %}

To understand how the base gun works, open the tweak browser in WolvenKit and search for `Items.Preset_Unity_Default`.

After locating the Unity gun in the tweak browser, right-click on the item and select "Add TweakXL Override". This allows you to modify and customize the weaponâ€™s attributes to create your new iconic weapon.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (185).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Red arrow = Tweak Name, where you can override it. Blue Box= Details about selected tweak. White arrow = Overridden (New) Tweak </p></figcaption></figure>

## Step 4: Open the Overridden Tweak in a Code Editor

Open the overridden tweak file in a code editor of your choice (such as Notepad++ or VS Code). You will be presented with a `.yaml` file containing numerous fields.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (186).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>"Items.Preset_Unity_Default" tweak opened in VS Code</p></figcaption></figure>

## Step 5: Understand the Fields in the .yaml File

{% hint style="info" %}
For first time modders, understanding all this in one go will be difficult, so keep these explanations handy and revisit them as and when required
{% endhint %}

The .yaml file may seem complex at first glance, but here's a breakdown of key fields in another weapon tweak (`Items.Preset_Sidewinder_Default`) : (Thanks to BuffMcMuff)

## Step 6: Making a New Weapon

Making a new weapon is fairly simple. Change the Item ID a the very first line to "Items.Hand\_Of\_Midas" and save your file.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```yaml
Items.Preset_Unity_Default: -> Remove this
Items.Hand_Of_Midas: -> Add this
```
{% endcode %}

That's it, you've created a new weapon now. This weapon will look & behave exactly like the Unity handgun, but trust me, it's new.&#x20;

To test it out, boot up your game and load any save.

Now open up the CET [Console](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP5jWcLZLbbbzO-\_ua1-887967055/console/console "mention"):

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Red arrow = Open CET Console. Green arrow = Command to spawn in the newly created gun</p></figcaption></figure>

Type in the command below and hit Enter.

```
 Game.AddToInventory("Items.Hand_Of_Midas",1)
```

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Your newly created weapon is now in game.</p></figcaption></figure>

You can now see your newly created weapon in your inventory. But, there is no way to tell it apart from the Unity handgun. We'll get to fixing that, but first some clean up. Open up your WolvenKit & rename your overriden tweak file to "hand\_of\_midas.yaml". We will store all the edits that need to be done to our new weapon in this file.

## Step 7: Making a New Weapon feel New

Let's change something that will differentiate our weapon from the default Unity.&#x20;

To do this, open your renamed tweak file & find the "crosshair" tag. Then replace it as shown below, and save your file.

```yaml
  crosshair: Crosshairs.Simple -> remove this
  crosshair: Crosshairs.Tech_Round -> add this
```

Now hot reload your game (Insert how to link here) or close it, then click install in WolvenKit & relaunch your game (From here on, this will be referred to as hot reload). Spawn in both the Unity & Hand of Midas using the CET console.

```
Game.AddToInventory("Items.Hand_Of_Midas",1)
Game.AddToInventory("Items.Preset_Unity_Default",1)
```

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Default Unity crosshair</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Hand of Midas crosshair</p></figcaption></figure>

You should now be able to see that both the Unity & Hand Of Midas, although otherwise identical, now have different crosshairs. But how did we figure out the crosshair ID "Crosshairs.Tech\_Round" ? By searching for "Crosshairs." in the Tweak Browser. Most things we find inside the weapon tweak will be searchabled within the Tweak Browser, and some within the Asset Browser.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>List of crosshairs obtained with a Tweak Browser search</p></figcaption></figure>

Editing the Tweak will allow us to modify all of our gun's behaviors, and I encourage you to play around with these.

## Step 8: Using $base instead of $type

We now have a big tweak file for Hand of Midas with only 1 field that we are truly changing, which is the crosshair. There is no need to write so much redundant code for small changes, in fact, it's best practice not to.

```yaml
Items.Hand_Of_Midas:
  $base: Items.Preset_Unity_Default
  Just the properties we want to edit ...

OR

Items.Hand_Of_Midas:
  $type: gamedataWeaponItem_Record
  All the other properties ...
```

As shown above, when using $type to define a tweak, we need to add all the required properties for the type, but when using $base to define one, we only need to add the properties we are changing, the rest are taken from the parent.

Now go ahead and change it so we use a base & only define the crosshair, your tweak should now look like this -

```yaml
Items.Hand_Of_Midas:
  $base: Items.Preset_Unity_Default
  crosshair: Crosshairs.Tech_Round
```

## Step 9: Names & Descriptions

What good is a new gun without a new name? To start customizing your gun's name and description, open your WolvenKit project and navigate to the archive folder. Here, create a new folder named after your mod, for instance, "midas\_collection". Within this folder, make another named "localization".&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>mod name folder &#x26; localization folder</p></figcaption></figure>

Next, focus on understanding how the game assigns names to items. Take the Unity gun as an example. In its tweak file, search for the "displayName" field. You'll likely encounter something like `displayName: LocKey#49794`, which implies the name is tied to a localization key. This approach is used to facilitate the translation of names and descriptions across different languages.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>LocKey Browser search for <code>LocKey#49794</code></p></figcaption></figure>

Such localization keys correspond to entries in "onscreens.json" files, which can be viewed in the asset browser - one for each language.

Editing the main "onscreens.json" file directly for your mod can cause conflicts, especially when multiple modders are working on separate items. To avoid these issues, create a dedicated "en-us.json" file in your "midas\_collection - localization" folder to add your mod-specific entries there. This method helps to maintain separation between your mod and others, preventing any overwrite issues.

{% file src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/en-us.json" %}
Copy this file and place it in archive -> mod name -> localization
{% endfile %}

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Red arrow = localization json added correctly. Green arrow = add new element in the json. Yellow arrow = key fields in new entry</p></figcaption></figure>

After setting up your localization file, it's crucial to properly link it to your weapon in the game. This involves defining specific properties in the file. Assign the `femaleVariant` property to your gun's name, in this case, "Hand Of Midas". Next, create a unique identifier called `secondaryKey`, such as "MC\_gun\_name", which will serve as a unique reference within the localization system. These properties help ensure that your weapon's name and description are correctly recognized in different languages. For more detailed guidance on these properties, check out the [ArchiveXL Wiki](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl/wiki#localization).

To make the game recognize your new localization file, you need to include it via ArchiveXL. In your WolvenKit project, go to the resources folder and create a plain text file with the following contents:

```yaml
localization:
  onscreens:
    en-us: midas_collection\localization\en-us.json
```

Rename this file to `midas_collection.archive.xl`. This step is crucial as it tells the game where to find the localization information for your mod.

Next, revisit your "hand\_of\_midas" tweak file to establish the weapon's name and description in the game. Add the following lines under the existing properties:

```yaml
Items.Hand_Of_Midas:
  $base: Items.Preset_Unity_Default
  crosshair: Crosshairs.Tech_Round
  displayName: LocKey#MC_gun_name
  localizedDescription: LocKey#MC_gun_description
```

These lines set the display name and the description of your weapon using the keys defined in your localization file. `LocKey#MC_gun_name` and `LocKey#MC_gun_description` refer to the entries you've created in "en-us.json", which provide the actual name and description text for your weapon.

After completing these steps, install your mod and launch the game. Your new weapon, "Hand Of Midas", should now appear with its unique name and description, fully integrated into Cyberpunk 2077's multi-language environment.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Name &#x26; Description of the gun are now taken from "en-us.json" that we've created</p></figcaption></figure>
