# R\&R: Emissive

This page is a part of the [Recolours and Refit guide](broken-reference) and will tell you how to change the suits' emissive materials.&#x20;

[The first section](r-and-r-emissive.md#switching-existing-colours) will show you how to swap between existing colours in the .yaml file.

The second section will show you how to [change the existing presets](r-and-r-emissive.md#changing-the-presets).&#x20;

#### **Time to complete:**&#x20;

* \~ 30 min **tops** for the tutorial
* once you know how it works:&#x20;
  * < 1 minute for .yaml edits
  *   < 5 minutes for material edits



## Switching existing colours

Since ArchiveXL's [Dynamic Appearances](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] feature is **that** cool, you can switch the emissive material simply by changing the property in the .yaml file. You can choose from the following emissive colours:

| Static            | Animated                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| blue              | glitch\_blue              |
| green             | glitch\_green             |
| orange            | glitch\_orange            |
| pink              | glitch\_pink              |
| violet            | glitch\_violet            |
| turquoise         | glitch\_turquoise         |
| red               | glitch\_red               |
| white             | glitch\_white             |
| yellow            | glitch\_yellow            |
| gold (warm white) | glitch\_gold (warm white) |
| black             | glitch\_greenblue         |
|                   | glitch\_darkblue          |
|                   | glitch\_matrix            |
| off               | glitch\_redblack          |

To change the emissive of an existing suit, you only need to change a single thing in the yaml file. Find it in your game directory:

```
Cyberpunk 2077\r6\tweaks\manavortex\_ArchiveXL_Netrunner_variants.yaml
```

Open it in a text editor, and find the list `$instances` near the top of the file. It will look like this:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/netrunner_suits_emissive.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Change the current entry against one from the list above. Make sure that you don't delete the comma or the colon, the amount of spaces only matters at the **beginning** of a line (other than for my personal OCD).

Save the file and start the game.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
If you did everything correctly, the emissive will now have a different colour.&#x20;

If you made a spelling mistake (or selected the appearance `off`), then the emissive will be gone.

If V is naked, then you fucked up (deleted the , or the :). In that case, remember that you can un-do the last change with `Ctrl+Z`!
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Can I do this for every mod???</summary>

Unfortunately not! The mod author has to enable this feature via [archivexl-dynamic-appearances.md](../adding-new-items/archivexl-dynamic-appearances.md "mention") and split/colorize their meshes accordingly.

If a mod doesn't mention in the description that they support this feature, you can use the techniques under [r-and-r-colour-editing.md](r-and-r-colour-editing.md "mention") to make your own recolours anyway.

## Changing the presets

{% hint style="info" %}
I won't document this step-by-step (yet), since it's pretty self-explanatory once you have the right file open.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

All the emissive materials live in .mi files. Inside the archive, they're bundled in this folder:

<pre><code><strong>manavortex\torso\netrunning_suit\textures\emissive
</strong></code></pre>

Each file will be named `emissive_VARIANT`, (`VARIANT` being the colour as listed in the table above). E.g., the file for the regular green emissive will be called `emissive_green.mi`

See [#step-0-extracting-the-right-file](r-and-r-colour-editing.md#step-0-extracting-the-right-file "mention") on [r-and-r-colour-editing.md](r-and-r-colour-editing.md "mention") for how to extract the file.&#x20;

Open the file in Wolvenkit and check the `values`. You'll see something like this:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/netrunner_suits_emissive_properties.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can change the values in the panel on the right â€” feel free to experiment. You can make a copy first in case you break something, but even then, you can still install the original mod again and re-extract the file.

{% hint style="info" %}
All emissive files use one of two templates:

`manavortex\torso\netrunning_suit\textures\emissive\_emissive_glitch_base.mi`

`manavortex\torso\netrunning_suit\textures\emissive\_emissive_base.mi`

If you are missing any properties, open the template and copy them from there.
{% endhint %}

## OK, what now?

Time to test! Install and launch your Wolvenkit project:

<figure><img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MP_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r%2Fuploads%2FUs6kZEwmFHhn8f8QCIKb%2Fwolvenkit_install_and_launch.png?alt=media&#x26;token=66c24ef4-0525-4476-80a2-aaf461f445ac" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you did everything right, your recolour will now be active.&#x20;

Otherwise, check [r-and-r-troubleshooting.md](r-and-r-troubleshooting.md "mention").
