{% hint style="info" %}
This section collects information for vehicle modding. However, all we have as of now are two links.

Boe6 has been so nice to share their (very detailed) [guide on Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a5Xvviw\_GQxcvbxEwc3GoboaNk0igxlhiyS7ux34sIs/edit?usp=sharing) and given full permission to transfer it to the wiki. However, nothing has happened yet.

A second guide is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1db16DhXj8xxDnLJryGW6Ge5p39NDrPVRU5Gs6f3YGoI/edit), although it is not very detailed.
