REDmod is a command line tool developed by CDPR and Yigsoft which allows us to interact with game files in a variety of ways

Modules for mod creators:

```
resource-export  - Export REDengine files to raw format for editing
resource-import  - Import raw files to REDengine formats for use in your mod
animation-import - import .re animation files to an animset
util-hash        - Hashes paths/string with given hash algorithm
help             - Displays helpful info about the other avaliable modules (use -h or -help on any command)
```
