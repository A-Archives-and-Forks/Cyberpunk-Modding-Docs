## Ungrouped vertices found

This should only happen for meshes with armatures.

1. Switch to the Data tab (the green triangle)
2. If you don't have vertex groups, add one
3. If you already have vertex groups, select the one named to the bone closest to your ungrouped vertices
4. If you aren't already, switch to Edit Mode (Hotkey: `Tab`)
5. Click the "Assign" button under the vertex groups panel
