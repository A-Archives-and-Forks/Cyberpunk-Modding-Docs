# Installing the Wolvenkit Blender Plugin

## Step 0: Uninstall the old version

{% hint style="info" %}
If you never installed a previous version of the plugin, you can go straight to [#step-1-install-the-plugin](installing-the-wolvenkit-blender-plugin.md#step-1-install-the-plugin "mention")
{% endhint %}

1. Open the Blender Preferences (Toolbar: `Edit` -> `Preferences`) and select the `AddOns` tab

Complete either of the options below:

#### Click the  `Remove` button

The build-in Blender way. Should work. If it doesn't check the second option

#### Delete the files on your disk

Check the plugin's `file` entry. It will usually be something like this:

```
%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.0\scripts\addons\i_scene_cp77_gltf
```

Navigate there with your Windows Explorer (Hotkey: `Windows+R`, paste the path above after changing your Blender version), and delete everything â€” either the entire folder, or all files inside.

Optional: Close and re-open Blender
{% endhint %}

## Step 1: Install the plugin

Download the latest version of the plugin from **github:**&#x20;

1. On the [releases](https://github.com/WolvenKit/Cyberpunk-Blender-add-on/releases) page, find the most recent release
2. Scroll past the change notes to the **Assets** section
3. Download the zip file with the plugin:

3. Start Blender
4. Open the Blender Preferences (Toolbar: `Edit` -> `Preferences`) and select the `AddOns` tab

5. Click the "Install" button and select the zip file you downloaded in step 2

## Step 2: Enable the plugin

{% hint style="info" %}
You only need to do this if you never installed the plugin before.
{% endhint %}

After you have successfully installed the plugin, you can now use the search bar to find it:

Make sure the box is checked and restart Blender.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't (un)install the plugin!

You can do both by hand. Find your Blender install's plugin folder, the path will look something like this (replace 3.6 with your Blender version):

```
%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.6\scripts\addons
```

Inside the plugins folder, the Wolvenkit Blender IO Suite will be installed to the subfolder `i_scene_cp77_gltf`.

To uninstall the plugin, delete the entire folder.

To install the plugin, find the folder in your downloaded zip file that contains the file **`__init__.py`**, move it here, and rename it.

Now, **restart Blender**.
