## Setup

To use the utmost capabilities of MLSB, all the meshes from the game have to be exported in .glb format and the masks layers exported in .dds format, exporting them all would be around 20 GBs or so.

The process of doing so are done by uncooking the main archives or automating the whole process using the [WCLI-Kommander tool ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/786000889298288690/945423019935932526/WCLI-Kommander.7z)found the [Cyberpunk 2077 Modding Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EgGjBr2Kfj), it's a batch file that uses Wolvenkit.CLI as a way to export, available under the channel [#resources](https://discord.com/channels/705931815109656596/786000889298288690/945423020107902986)
