# MO2 (Mod Organizer 2)

MO2 (Mod Organizer 2) is a free mod manager that is widely used in modding Bethesda games like Skyrim. MO2 also works for Cyberpunk 2077 and is easy to use.

### Setup

* Download MO2 ([https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) or on the website: [https://www.modorganizer.org/](https://www.modorganizer.org/))
* Using a "portable instance" when prompted is an easy way to use MO2

### Installing Mods

* Install Red4Ext and CET **manually** (unzip into the game folder)
* Install the rest of your mods normally with MO2 (on Nexus click "download with manager")

That's all. Remember to:&#x20;
