# MO2 (Mod Organizer 2)

MO2 (Mod Organizer 2) is a free mod manager that is widely used in modding Bethesda games like Skyrim or Fallout. It supports Cyberpunk and is easy to use.

### Installing mods

* Install MO2
* Install CET and Red4ext manually (or with rootbuilder). These mods are script extenders and need to be present in the roor game folder.
* Install the rest of the mods simply with the Nexus "install with manager" button
* Always launch the game through MO2

That's all. Using MO2 leaves your base game directory untouched, and you can easily install and uninstall mods, update old mods or use profiles.
