## Summary

This page will explain to you what Load Order is and how it works, then tell you how to influence it.

## TL;DR

You're not supposed to manage load order conflicts outside of `.archive` mods and REDmods. If you ever feel the need to do that, a modder fucked up.

* For REDmods, see [#conflicts-and-load-order](redmod/usage.md#conflicts-and-load-order "mention")
* For .archive mods, use Fuzzo's **Archive Conflict Checker Tool** ([Nexus link](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/11126)).

## What is Load Order?

Unless two mods are changing the same file, you don't need to bother about this at all. Unfortunately, the moment you're using frameworks or anything body modding related, you _will_ run into this scenario.&#x20;

In Cyberpunk, whatever `.archive` modifies a file **first** will win â€“ unlike e.g. Skyrim, where mods overwrite each other.

#### Example

There are two mods who change boob size

```
i_know_nothing_about_back_problems.archive
realistic_boobs_DDDDDDDDD_cup.archive
```

Since **i\_know\_nothing\_about\_back\_problems** will load first, **realistic\_boobs\_DDDDDDDDD\_cup** does nothing.

## How are mods ordered?

The game loads mods in the following order

### 1. Legacy mods

Anything in `Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/mod`

### 2. REDmods

Anything in `Cyberpunk 2077/mods`

### Load order: ASCII sort

The game reads mods in ASCII-alphabetical order (REDmods by **folder name**, .archive files by **archive file name**).

This is ASCII ordering:

#### Example

| Mod name       | Pos | why               |
| -------------- | --- | ----------------- |
| MyMod.archive  | 2   | M comes before m  |
| myMod.archive  | 3   |                   |
| !myMod.archive | 1   | ! comes before A  |

## How to use this?

You can re-name your folders and .archive files following the rules under [#load-order-ascii-sort](load-order.md#load-order-ascii-sort "mention") to influence in which order the game will load your mods, or you can use Fuzzo's **Archive Conflict Checker Tool** ([Nexus link](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/11126)).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Prefixing your archive file names with non-alphanumeric characters works fine in case of Cyberpunk, but is a terrible habit that might break file paths in other games or operating systems.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will forget the warning above and re-learn this the hard way.
{% endhint %}

## More Examples

If you are creating a **compatibility mod** (something that modifies the files of another installed mod), then yours needs to load **first**.

For example, if you want to do a custom recolour of the mod [`_ArchiveXL_Netrunner_Variants.archive`](../../for-mod-creators/modding-guides/items-equipment/recolours-and-refits/), then your Wolvenkit project could be named `_00_ArchiveXL_Netrunner_Variants`, or `_ArchiveXL_Netrunner_00_Recolour`.
