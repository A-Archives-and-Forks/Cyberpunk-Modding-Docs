title: yaml editing warning
---

`.yaml` files use indentation (the number of spaces at the beginning of a line) to organize entries in groups. This is easy to break!

If you run into problems, you can check your file by validating it (e.g. on [yamllint.com](https://www.yamllint.com/)). If that doesn't help, you can check `red4ext/plugins/TweakXL/TweakXL.log` for error messages.
