title: yaml editing warning
---

`.yaml` files use **indentation** (the number of spaces at the beginning of a line) to organize entries in groups. This is easy to break!

If you run into problems, you can check your file on [yamllint.com](https://www.yamllint.com/). \
If that doesn't help, see if `red4ext/plugins/TweakXL/TweakXL.log` has any hits for your mod.
