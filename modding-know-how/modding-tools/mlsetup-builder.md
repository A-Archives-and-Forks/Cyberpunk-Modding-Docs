## Setup

To use the utmost capabilities of MLSB, all the meshes from the game have to be exported in .glb format and the masks layers exported in .dds format, exporting them all would be around 20 GBs or so.

The process of doing so are done by uncooking the main archives. To do so, you need to setup a folder in the software preferences, choose the Wolvenkit-CLI executable, at least version 1.5.2 and from the build menu use the commands Build the repository, then do the same with the microblends, normals and decals.\
There is also a dedicated thread on the [Cyberpunk 2077 Modding Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/705931815109656596/939510887188947014) with the latest software updates.
