# ðŸ‘¤ Animations

## Summary

This page contains t**heoretical knowledge** about animations and poses (static animations) in Cyberpunk 2077.  If you want to **make** poses (for photo mode or AMM) instead, see [here](../modding-guides/animations/).

{% hint style="info" %}
There is (almost) nothing here yet. Maybe you are the right person to fix this? This wiki is a collaborative effort, **please** get involved!
{% endhint %}

## First person

First person animations are used solely on the player character (V). There's one rig per body gender:

| name of rig    | Path in game files |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| player\_male   |                    |
| player\_female |                    |

## Third person

{% hint style="info" %}
While most rigs are called `man_xxx`, they're also used by NPCs of the female body gender.
{% endhint %}

| Name of rig  | Used by                                                | Path in game files |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| woman\_base  | female body gender, default body shape                 |                    |
| man\_base    | male body gender, default body shape                   |                    |
