# Troubleshooting your mesh edits

## Importing

### Something with bones

WolvenKit will check your 3d object's **vertex groups** against the **bones** in the associated rig. If your mesh is missing bones, then you won't be able to import.

To resolve this, import over a different mesh that has all the bones, or look into [this tutoria](https://xbaebsae.jimdofree.com/tutorials/cp2077-transferring-and-expanding-skeletons-in-meshes/)l as for how to transfer bones from one armature to the other.

### Everything else

WolvenKit will not import a mesh that has any kind of issues. Those include, but are not limited to:&#x20;

* non-flat faces
* zero faces/edges
* loose vertices/edges

**There is no guarantee that any of the steps below will actually solve your problem.**&#x20;

#### **Edit Mode**

In Edit Mode, you can find a few commands in the Mesh -> Clean Up menu:

* Delete Loose
* Split Non-Planar Faces
* Split Concave Faces
* Merge By Distance\


{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;If you select your whole mesh, **Merge By Distance** will merge the individual parts, obliterating the seams. To avoid that, make sure to do them one after another:\
\- Select a vertex/edge/face in Edit Mode\
\- hold down Ctrl Num+ to select everything connected\
\- use Merge By Distance before proceeding to the next part of your mesh
{% endhint %}

#### It's still broken

Your last option is the [3d print tool](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/mesh/3d\_print\_toolbox.html) to (hopefully) find out what is wrong with your mesh.&#x20;

Fortunately, the tool is free, easy-to-use and already included in your Blender.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have a 3d print entry in the tools of your 3d viewport, you might need to enable the plugin in Blender's settings first.
{% endhint %}

* Zero Edges: Those are bad, fix them (click on them, then press X and just delete them)
* Non-Flat Faces: Those are even worse, as they can make the game crash. You need to split them up until they are flat, or investigate the surrounding edges/vertices to see what's going wrong here.
* Zero Faces: Only fix if you have <100 of them â€” the tool doesn't always identify them correctly (the mesh analyzed above was `h0_000_pwa_c__basehead`, which is absolutely fine).&#x20;



## In-Game

### My mesh is completely warped

If you have [added the item](../../modding-guides/items/adding-new-items.md) via [ArchiveXL](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl) or [swapped out an in-game item](../../modding-guides/items/editing-existing-items/replace-a-player-item-with-an-npc-item.md) with something that belongs in a different slot (e.g. a jacket on the head slot), you might have to fix the corresponding entity file.

### My mesh is string cheese/exploding vertices

#### GarmentSupports

{% hint style="info" %}
To check if it's this, equip **only** the edited item. If it breaks as soon as you put on another clothing item with [garment supports](garment-support-how-does-it-work.md#the-algorithm), then the solution below applies.
{% endhint %}

Delete GarmentSupport from the mesh:
