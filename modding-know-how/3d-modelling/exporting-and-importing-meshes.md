This guide will show you how to\
\- export meshes from the game to edit them in other software\
\- import those meshes back into WolvenKit

Assumed skill level: You are able to read and comprehend instructions.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to replace meshes without editing them, check [this guide](../../modding-guides/items/editing-existing-items/replace-a-player-item-with-an-npc-item.md).

You can import and export meshes via WolvenKit **or** Noesis - both methods work.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Before you start to edit, a word of warning:**

It is easy to [break a mesh](exporting-and-importing-meshes.md#troubleshooting-i-cant-import-my-mesh) beyond the point of repair. Make frequent back-ups, and continuously test if your altered mesh still imports and displays in WolvenKit, **especially when editing vertices!**
{% endhint %}

## Exporting the mesh

### WolvenKit (\*.gdb)

WolvenKit <= [8.8](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit/releases/tag/8.8.0): Use the Import/Export tool. It is pinned to the sidebar on the right.

WolvenKit > 8.8: Use the Export tool. You can toggle it from the "Tools" menu on the top bar.

{% hint style="success" %}
Select your mesh in the Export Tool and click "Export/Process Selected".&#x20;

This will create `meshName.glb` in your WKit project's [`raw` directory.](exporting-and-importing-meshes.md#path-example)
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Displayed: WKit 8.8</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Exporting with materials

{% hint style="info" %}
For WolvenKit versions > 8.8, this is the default behaviour.
{% endhint %}

To export a mesh with materials for import with the [Cyberpunk Blender Plugin](https://github.com/WolvenKit/Cyberpunk-Blender-add-on), double-click on it to display the export settings. Set **`MeshExportType`** as `WithMaterials`.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Path example&#x20;

Assuming you are exporting `t2_002_pwa_vest__puffy.mesh`, WolvenKit will do the following:

Path of mesh: `<yourModDir>\archive\source\base\characters\garment\player_equipment\torso\t2_002_vest__puffy\t2_002_pwa_vest__puffy.mesh`

Path of gdb: `<yourModDir>\archive\raw\base\characters\garment\player_equipment\torso\t2_002_vest__puffy\t2_002_pwa_vest__puffy.gdb`

### Noesis (\*.fbx)

{% hint style="danger" %}
The [Noesis Import/Export Plugin](https://github.com/alphazolam/fmt\_CP77mesh?msclkid=384152bfaa5611ecbad0234dbe6a5c45) is required for this.
{% endhint %}

Noesis is an **alternative** to exporting with WolvenKit. There are legitimate use cases for why you would want this. If you don't know them, you'll probably not want to use this.

Find your mesh in Noesis. Right-click and select "Export".

## Blender: Saving the mesh

### for WolvenKit (\*.gdb)

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eauWYiF.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Export settings: "Tangents" must be checked</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
I recommend disabling materials, especially if you've wildly messed around with the shaders while you've been editing.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For WolvenKit > 8.8 and < 8.9, make sure to delete MeshName.Material.json from the raw directory.
{% endhint %}

### Noesis (\*.fbx)

Simply export as fbx, Blender's standard settings are alright for Noesis.

## Importing to \*.mesh

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are following a guide with pre-made resources and it tells you to import via Noesis, you'll want to follow the advice, as the elements in the exported structure will have different names.
{% endhint %}

### WolvenKit (\*.gdb)

You should have overwritten your previous gdb export. With WKit's Import/Export tool, you can now use the **import** tab and get it back in.

{% hint style="info" %}
WolvenKit will map any \*.gdb file under `raw` to the mesh with the same name under `source`.

Example:

`<yourModDir>\archive\raw\base\characters\garment\player_equipment\torso\t2_002_vest__puffy\t2_002_pwa_vest__puffy.gdb`&#x20;

will be imported over

`<yourModDir>\archive\source\base\characters\garment\player_equipment\torso\t2_002_vest__puffy\t2_002_pwa_vest__puffy.mesh`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
WolvenKit refuses to import if the target mesh doesn't support all bones in the gdb or if your mesh's topology became corrupted.
{% endhint %}

### Noesis (\*.fbx)

{% hint style="danger" %}
The [Noesis Import/Export Plugin](https://github.com/alphazolam/fmt\_CP77mesh?msclkid=384152bfaa5611ecbad0234dbe6a5c45) is required for this.
{% endhint %}

Noesis is an **alternative** to importing with WolvenKit.

Find your fbx in Noesis. Right-click and select "Import".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/noesis_mesh_import.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need to select a target mesh to import over.
{% endhint %}

## Troubleshooting: I can't import my mesh

### Something with bones

WolvenKit will check your 3d object's **vertex groups** against the **bones** in the associated rig. If your mesh is missing bones, then you won't be able to import.

To resolve this, import over a different mesh that has all the bones, or look into [this tutoria](https://xbaebsae.jimdofree.com/tutorials/cp2077-transferring-and-expanding-skeletons-in-meshes/)l as for how to transfer bones from one armature to the other.

### Everything else

WolvenKit will not import a mesh that has any kind of issues. Those include, but are not limited to:&#x20;

* non-flat faces
* zero faces/edges
* loose vertices/edges

**There is no guarantee that any of the steps below will actually solve your problem.**&#x20;

#### **Edit Mode**

In Edit Mode, you can find a few commands in the Mesh -> Clean Up menu:

* Delete Loose
* Split Non-Planar Faces
* Split Concave Faces
* Merge By Distance\


{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;If you select your whole mesh, **Merge By Distance** will merge the individual parts, obliterating the seams. To avoid that, make sure to do them one after another:\
\- Select a vertex/edge/face in Edit Mode\
\- hold down Ctrl Num+ to select everything connected\
\- use Merge By Distance before proceeding to the next part of your mesh
{% endhint %}

#### It's still broken

Your last option is the [3d print tool](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/mesh/3d\_print\_toolbox.html) to (hopefully) find out what is wrong with your mesh.&#x20;

Fortunately, the tool is free, easy-to-use and already included in your Blender.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have a 3d print entry in the tools of your 3d viewport, you might need to enable the plugin in Blender's settings first.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/blender 3d print tool.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use the 3d print tool in edit mode to directly fix your issues</p></figcaption></figure>

* Zero Edges: Those are bad, fix them (click on them, then press X and just delete them)
* Non-Flat Faces: Those are even worse, as they can make the game crash. You need to split them up until they are flat, or investigate the surrounding edges/vertices to see what's going wrong here.
* Zero Faces: Only fix if you have <100 of them â€” the tool doesn't always identify them correctly (the mesh analysed above was `h0_000_pwa_c__basehead`, which is absolutely fine).&#x20;
