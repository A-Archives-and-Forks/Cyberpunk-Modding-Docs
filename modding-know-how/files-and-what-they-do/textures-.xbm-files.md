### Wait, this isn't what I want!

Would you ratherâ€¦

* [Edit, import, or export](../textures/images-importing-editing-exporting.md) textures?
* Learn about [textured materials](../materials/#textured)?
* Use [a textured material](../../modding-guides/everything-else/textured-items-and-cyberpunk-materials.md#material-assignments) on your mesh?
