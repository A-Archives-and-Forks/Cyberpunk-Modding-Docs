## Running Python scripts in Blender

This guide is for running files outside of **Blender**.&#x20;

If you want to run a Python script in Blender, you need to switch your viewport to the scripting perspective and click "play".&#x20;

You can find a dedicated guide on [blender-running-python-scripts.md](blender-running-python-scripts.md "mention") in the 3d editing section.

## Step 0: Getting Python

We start by checking if you have Python installed already.

1. Open a Windows command prompt (Hotkeys: `Windows+R`, type `cmd`, press enter)
2. In the window that now opens, type the following:

```
python --version
```

If you have Python installed, it will now say something like "`Python 3.11.3`" . In that case, you can go directly to [#step-1-downloading-the-script](running-python-scripts.md#step-1-downloading-the-script "mention").

Otherwise, please keep reading.

3. Close the command window - after installing Python, you need to open a new one.
4. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the correct installer package for your system - that will usually be Windows installer (64-bit). Take the latest stable release, it will be at the very top of the page.

3. Now, follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10) until you have installed Python, or google something like `install python on windows for dummies` and follow that guide until you have installed Python.
4. Proceed to [#step-1-downloading-the-script](running-python-scripts.md#step-1-downloading-the-script "mention")

## Step 1: Downloading the script

The link in this guide is an example script in case you don't have one. If you do, use that one instead.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to mana's github repo and grab the [.py script to merge AMM presets](https://github.com/manavortex/cyberpunk2077/blob/master/python/merge\_amm\_presets.py): &#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/download_from_github.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Yes, github is scary, this is scary code. Don't worry, I gotchu.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. Download the file by clicking the corresponding button. Save it somewhere where you can find it easily.
3. Open the script with a text editor of your choice (we recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) under Windows)
4. Check the top of the file for anything that needs to be adjusted:
   1. Ignore the lines starting with `import`
   2. Read the lines starting with `#`. They are **comments** and will tell you what to put.
5. Once you have everything set up, save the script.

Now it is time to run it. Keep reading!

## Step 2: Run the script

1. Open a command window again (Hotkey: Windows+R, type `cmd`, press enter)
2. Type `python "` (`python`, space, quotation mark)
3. Drag-and-drop the script you downloaded on the console window
4. Type another quotation mark and hit enter

{% hint style="info" %}
The quotation marks will prevent error with spaces in path names. Leave them away at own risk :)
{% endhint %}

That's it - the script will now run and do things

## Troubleshooting

### It complains about errors!

1. Step the Python version ([#step-0-getting-python](running-python-scripts.md#step-0-getting-python "mention"), item 1 and 2). As of 2023, the version should start with a 3.

If that isn't it, you made a mistake while editing the script file. Make sure that you don't have single backslashes in strings:

```python
bad  = "C:\Games\Cyberpunk 2077"
good = "C:\\Games\\Cyberpunk 2077"
```

If it's not that, you can use a [Python syntax checker](https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html), or ask ChatGPT (I'm not kidding). Good luck!

### No module namedâ€¦

If you are running into this error in **Blender**, it should be enough to run the program as admin.

Otherwise, you are missing a **Python module**, and need to install it. You can do that by running the following code from your Windows cmd:

```
pip install <your_module_name>
```

If that does not work, google for something like `pip install module your_module_name windows`.&#x20;
