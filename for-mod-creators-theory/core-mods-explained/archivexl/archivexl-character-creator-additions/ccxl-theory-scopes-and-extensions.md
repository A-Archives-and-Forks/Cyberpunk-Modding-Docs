## Hair materials

The full list of hair style materials as supported by CCXL extension:

| material for chunkmask | parameter name in @context |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `@beard`               | `BeardBaseMaterial`        |
| `@braid`               | `BraidBaseMaterial`        |
| `@cap`                 | `CapBaseMaterial`          |
| `@cap01`               | `CapBaseMaterial`          |
| `@curls`               | `CurlsBaseMaterial`        |
| `@dread`               | `DreadBaseMaterial`        |
| `@long`                | `LongBaseMaterial`         |
| `@short`               | `ShortBaseMaterial`        |
| `@brows`               | `BrowsBaseMaterial`        |
| `@lashes`              | `LashesBaseMaterial`       |

{% hint style="info" %}
While `@cap01` falls back to CapBaseMaterial, this is how you can define an extra hair cap texture for `cyberware_01`.&#x20;
