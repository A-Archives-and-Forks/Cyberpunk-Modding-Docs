### Streamingblock

The game contains only 3 streamingblocks that gather more than 26300 sectors.\
We will focus on the main one and take a look at the first sector inside (`exterior_-18_3_-12_0`).

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating a mod with sectors, you will need to create your own block that will list your new sectors.
{% endhint %}

This sector has 10 variants, in this case, each one is related to a quest state.

`numNodeRanges` indicate the number of node ranges the sector contains; it always corresponds to the number of variant + sector's default range (so here 10 variants + 1 default).

When opening a variant definition, we can find the range index (to find the right range inside the sector file). `rangeIndex` cannot be 0, 0 is used as sector's default range.

Variant's name is only used to identify the variant within the streamingblock.
