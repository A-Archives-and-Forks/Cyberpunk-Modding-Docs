## How do lights work?

## Directional lights

Cyberpunk uses three types of lights:&#x20;

### Point light

The light is a sphere and is equally bright in every direction

### Spot light

The light is a cone. The sharpness is defined by its inner and outer angle.&#x20;

### Area light

The light is a square (like a light panel).&#x20;
