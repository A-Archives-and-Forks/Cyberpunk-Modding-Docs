# Level of Detail (LoD)

## Summary

**Published**: Mar 02 2024 by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")\
**Last documented update**: Mar 02 2024 by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")

This page explains what **Level of Detail** is and how it works.

### Wait, this is not what I want!

## Level of Detail

{% hint style="success" %}
A high-detail mesh has a low Level of Detail, and vice versa. This is both intuitive and obvious, which is why there's an info box telling you about it.
{% endhint %}

The further away something is, the higher it's LOD will be (the less detail you will actually see, and the less detail will be rendered).&#x20;

### What controls LOD?

.streamingsector: forceAutoHideDistance



### But my modded items only have LOD0!

That is due to Wolvenkit: the [LOD filter](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/import-export/models#lod-filter) property will drop any submeshes for lower resolutions.&#x20;

For **equipment and weapons**, that is completely fine, because you don't need them (melee weapons aside, read on).

For [NPVs](../../modding-guides/npcs/npv-v-as-custom-npc/), you'll want to get rid of proxy appearances as well â€” we really can't be arsed to create custom ones.

### So let's get rid of all these high LOD submeshes!

**Please don't.**&#x20;

First of all, the high LODs occasionally store other properties. For **melee weapons**, they are used to [calculate the hitbox](../../modding-guides/items-equipment/adding-new-items/weapons/#editing-weapon-meshes) (or so we think, Mar 2024). For **vehicles**, they're needed for [damage deforms](../../modding-guides/vehicles/boe6s-guide-new-car-from-a-to-z/3d-body-modeling-import-export-meshes.md#add-the-proxy-mesh-to-the-project).

And second of all, without proxy meshes, your GPU will **catch fire** if you look at Night City's skyline. Yes, even the Tesseract.

### lodLevelInfo

As of May 2024, we don't know for certain what the numeric properties stand for (maybe the distance from player at which the level of detail gets activated?).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
LODs corresponds to `renderLOD`s. LODs without an entry in `renderLOD` will never load.
{% endhint %}

You can see submeshes and their LODs in the [Mesh Preview](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/editor/file-editor/preview#mesh-preview):

## Proxy meshes

{% hint style="info" %}
To learn more about [proxy-appearances.md](appearance-.app-files/proxy-appearances.md "mention"), check the corresponding wiki page.
{% endhint %}

A proxy mesh is used as an extremely low-level stand-in to be loaded for distant objects. They will almost always have `proxy` in their path or file name, and use a [PBR material](../references-lists-and-overviews/cheat-sheet-materials.md#pbr-material) such as metal\_base with low-resolution textures.

Example: Take a look at Johnny's proxy mesh under

```
base\characters\appearances\main_npc\proxy\silverhand_default\silverhand_default.mesh
```

## Shadow meshes

Shadow meshes are used to generate shadows at low performance cost. You can find more detailed documentation on the page about [meshes-shadows-and-shadow-meshes.md](3d-objects-.mesh-files/meshes-shadows-and-shadow-meshes.md "mention").

## Component property: forceLODLevel

This lets you override the level of detail&#x20;
