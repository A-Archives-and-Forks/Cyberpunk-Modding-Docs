This page explains how shadows are configured for nodes in streamingsectors.&#x20;

### Wait, this is not what I want!

* To learn how components (equipment) casts shadows, check [meshes-shadows-and-shadow-meshes.md](../3d-objects-.mesh-files/meshes-shadows-and-shadow-meshes.md "mention")

## Shadows

The shadow properties of the environment are configured in the properties of each node inside the `.streamingsector` file:

Shadows are only cast as long as a mesh is visible.

### Global and local shadows

A global shadow will not render small details â€” these will only be included if the castLocalShadows property is active.
