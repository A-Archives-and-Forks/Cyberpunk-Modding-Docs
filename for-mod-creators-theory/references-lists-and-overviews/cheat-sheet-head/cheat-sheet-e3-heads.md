### 2020 Marketing Head

```
base\characters\head\pwa\h0_000_pwa_c__basehead\
```

```
base\characters\head\pwa\h0_000_pwa_c__basehead\textures
```

These folders contain the V used in the early 2020 marketing materials and "The World of Cyberpunk 2077", the assets here more closely resemble the final game.

| File                                            | Description |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- |

## Male V

When compared to female V, male V has fewer remaining assets left over from development (mostly 2018 is missing). However, what we saw of male V in the 2019 Deep Dive demo, early 2020 trailers, and "The World of Cyberpunk 2077" remain behind.

### 2019 Deep Dive/2020 Marketing

```
base\characters\head\pma\h0_000_pma_c__basehead\
```

```
base\characters\head\pma\h0_000_pma_c__basehead\textures
```

```
base\characters\head\pma\h0_001_ma_c__player\textures
```

Note that not everything in the foremost folder will be listed, only what's important. There are simply too many assets to list here, most of which are identical to the final game if not straight duplicates.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important exception; outside of the above folder, somewhere else in a different folder is a beard mesh that is combined with 3D eyebrows and eyelashes.

### Textures

Textures for male V here are scattered across two different folders, `h0_000_pma_c__basehead` and `h0_001_ma_c__player` respectively.
