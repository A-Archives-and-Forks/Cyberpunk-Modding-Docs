### World Inspector

This CET widget lets you inspect the world around you, as well as the player and their equipment. Read more about it under [rht-the-world-inspector.md](rht-the-world-inspector.md "mention")

### Ink inspector

This CEt widget lets you inspect the game's interface. Read more about it under [rht-ink-inspector.md](rht-ink-inspector.md "mention")

### Hot Reload

This feature allows reloading mod files without restarting the game. You can use the CET widget to trigger it at any time, or rely on the integration with WolvenKit.
