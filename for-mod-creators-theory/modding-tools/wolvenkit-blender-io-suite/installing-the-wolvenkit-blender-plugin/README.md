**Last documented update:** Nov 29 2024 by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")

This page will show you how to install the Wolvenkit Blender Plugin from a github release or tag. If you want to install the bleeding edge, please check [installing-from-github-source.md](installing-from-github-source.md "mention") instead.

### Compatibility

## Optional: Uninstall the old version

{% hint style="info" %}
You don't need to do this unless you have trouble updating. Go straight to [#step-0-download-the-plugin](./#step-0-download-the-plugin "mention")
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Uninstalling the previous plugin version</summary>

1. Open the Blender Preferences (Toolbar: `Edit` -> `Preferences`) and select the `AddOns` tab

2. Complete either of the options below:
   * Click the  `Remove` button\
     The build-in Blender way. Should work. If it doesn't check the second option
   * Delete the files on your disk\
     Check the plugin's `file` entry. It will usually be something like this:

```
%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.3\scripts\addons\i_scene_cp77_gltf
```

Navigate there with your Windows Explorer (Hotkey: `Windows+R`, paste the path above after changing your Blender version), and delete everything â€” either the entire folder, or all files inside.

3. Optional: Close and re-open Blender

3. Click the "Install" button and select the zip file you downloaded in step 2

## Step 2: Enable the plugin

{% hint style="info" %}

Make sure the box is checked and restart Blender.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't (un)install the plugin!

You can do both by hand. Find your Blender install's plugin folder, the path will look something like this (replace 3.6 with your Blender version):

```
%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.3\scripts\addons
```

Inside the plugins folder, the Wolvenkit Blender IO Suite will be installed to the subfolder `i_scene_cp77_gltf`.

To **uninstall** the plugin, **delete** the entire folder.

To **install** the plugin, **find** the folder in your **downloaded zip file** that contains the file **`__init__.py`**, move it here, and rename it.

Now, **restart Blender**.
